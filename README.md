# Leetcode tasks solutions repo

Hello!

I, as the developer, always want to solve an interesting, advanced and complex tasks. Even if we work with something trivial daily. Leetcode helps us with it, providing interesting tasks with different complexity levels and interesting outcome.

This is my repo with all my tasks solution. These solution may and probably will evolve sometimes as I learn new approaches. I won't ling my leecode link here, I see no reason for that.

Anyway, I just want to keep my progress, this repo isn't even need by anyone else ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

## Run tasks

All tasks are tests-covered with different test sets or rather most critical tests sets.

Want to test it? Odd, but sure, no problem:

```shell
git clone <this repo>
cd task1234/go
go test -v
```

Cheers!
