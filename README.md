# Leetcode tasks solutions repo

Hello!

Me as the developer always want to solve an interesting, advanced and complex tasks. Even if we work with something trivial daily.

Leetcode helps us with it, providing interesting tasks with different complexity levels and interesting outcome.

This is my repo with all my tasks solution. These solution may and probably will evolve sometimes as I learn new approaches.

I won't ling my leetode link here, I see no reason for that.

Anyway, I just want to keep my progress, this repo isn't even need by anyone else ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Cheers!
